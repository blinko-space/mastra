# OTLP Providers (Deprecated)

<Callout type="warning">
  **Deprecation Notice**: OTLP-based tracing is being deprecated in favor of AI Tracing. For new projects, use the `observability` configuration with AI Tracing instead of the `telemetry` configuration.

  See the [migration guide](/examples/observability/migration-from-otlp.mdx) for details on moving to AI Tracing.
</Callout>

## Recommended Alternatives

For AI-specific observability, we recommend using:

- **[AI Tracing](/docs/observability/ai-tracing.mdx)** - Built-in AI-specific tracing
- **[Langfuse](/examples/observability/langfuse-integration.mdx)** - Open-source LLM observability
- **[Braintrust](/examples/observability/braintrust-integration.mdx)** - AI evaluation and monitoring
- **[Mastra Cloud](https://mastra.ai)** - Built-in cloud monitoring
